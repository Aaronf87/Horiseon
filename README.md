# Horiseon Webpage

### This Project was made as a refracting challenge in #1 in the coding bootcamp course.  


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website challenge had a premade website named Horiseon with HTML and CSS that needed refractoring.  Multiple accesability issues like repeated CSS code HTML non sematic elements (like div's), and overly specified CSS selectors were present in the starter code.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

 Git was used in the main branch to save commits every step of the way and then pushed to Git Hub.  The refractored version of the Horiseon web page was deployed in Git hub pages with an included link to the site below.
